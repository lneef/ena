Overview
========

ENA is a networking interface designed to make good use of modern CPU
features and system architectures.

The ENA device exposes a lightweight management interface with a
minimal set of memory mapped registers and extendible command set
through an Admin Queue.

The driver supports a range of ENA devices, is link-speed independent
(i.e., the same driver is used for 10GbE, 25GbE, 40GbE, etc), and has
a negotiated and extendible feature set.

Some ENA devices support SR-IOV. This driver is used for both the
SR-IOV Physical Function (PF) and Virtual Function (VF) devices.

ENA devices enable high speed and low overhead network traffic
processing by providing multiple Tx/Rx queue pairs (the maximum number
is advertised by the device via the Admin Queue), a dedicated MSI-X
interrupt vector per Tx/Rx queue pair, adaptive interrupt moderation,
and CPU cacheline optimized data placement.

The ENA driver supports industry standard TCP/IP offload features such as
checksum offload. Receive-side scaling (RSS) is supported for multi-core
scaling.

The ENA driver and its corresponding devices implement health
monitoring mechanisms such as watchdog, enabling the device and driver
to recover in a manner transparent to the application, as well as
debug logs.

Some of the ENA devices support a working mode called Low-latency
Queue (LLQ), which saves several more microseconds.
